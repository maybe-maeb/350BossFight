This is a short boss fight made for a class I'm in. It's not my best work, and there are a lot of things I would do differently if it were for a larger project.

This was made for educational purposes, not commercial. I won't be making any money on this project.  You are welcome to look through the files, but ask for permission before copying any part of it.
