{
   //Phase 1:
    //Dragon flies up and shoots fireballs
    //Every once in a while, it lands on a platform and rests
    //Players need to climb up to their platform while avoiding attacks and hit it

   //Phase 2:
    //The dragon burrows underground and moves around
    //Every once in a while, it shoot out of the ground. If the player is where it shoots out, they take damage
    //When it lands, it become vulnerable and players need to hit a highlighted area (maybe around the head)

   //Phase 3:
    //The dragon causes the sand to turn to quicksand, pulling the player underground
    //The dragon shoots fireballs from a platform as the player jumps across platforms to attack it
